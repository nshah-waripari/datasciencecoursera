# Code Book

## Subject and Activity

 - Subject: Integer as an identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment. 
 - Activity: List of activities as a string character carried out by the subject
  - Walking
  - Walking Upstairs
  - Walking Downstairs
  - Sitting
  - Standing
  - Laying

## Measurement Means
Two types of variables for each subject and activity
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
All variables are floating point numbers
